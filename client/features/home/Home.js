            <p className="homepage-paragraphs">GraceBuster, founded in the wake of the Blockbuster era, is a company dedicated to the preservation and promotion of vintage style movies. 
                Our journey began as a modest venture, fueled by our passion for classic cinema and a desire to keep the spirit of the golden age of film alive. 
                We saw an opportunity to fill the void left by the downfall of the once-mighty Blockbuster, and with determination and perseverance, we set out to become the new bastion for movie enthusiasts who appreciate the art and charm of vintage films.
            </p>
            <p className="homepage-paragraphs">Our humble rise to the forefront of the industry is a testament to the resilience of the GraceBuster team and the unwavering support of our loyal customers. 
                By staying true to our mission and embracing the lessons from the consequential past, we have become a beacon for those seeking a nostalgic and unique cinematic experience. 
                Today, we proudly curate an extensive collection of classic movies, ensuring that the timeless stories and memorable moments of the past remain accessible and relevant for generations to come.
